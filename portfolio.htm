<h2>University of Victoria Department of Chemistry<br />
Freelance Programmer</h2>
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
<img alt="Microfluidic chip" src="Images/chip.png" align="right" width=150>
Starting in March 2019, I developed a computer vision application that monitors the production of polymer nanoparticles being studied as a new cancer treatment. The program performs in seconds a task which formerly required 2-4 hours of a scientist's time.
This serves to increase the rate at which experiments can be performed, and effectively permits the scientist
to pursue more avenues in the course of research. I developed the software remotely in South Carolina, using
dataset samples from the lab in Victoria, Canada. Without local access to personnel or lab equipment, I developed the software remotely, maintaining good communication and correspondence with university science staff.
</p>

<img alt="Microfluidic channels" src="Images/channels.png" align="left" width=200 />


<p>
The software's purpose is to calculate the gas/liquid ratio
present in a microfluidic chip, by volume. We take a movie of the fluid flow in the chip with a digital camera. Then,
the software uses the image filters provided by Matlab to perform edge detection on the images and identify the boundaries of all gas bubbles. All of the boundaries in the movie are combined to obtain the silhouette of
the channels in which the fluid flows (see fig. left). Once the program knows the channel dimensions, it calls a C++ routine to trace a ray along the major axis of the channel, dividing it into segments of light and dark. From these segments, we determine
the positions of the channel loops and their radii. Once we know the positions of the channel loops, we can
then map any given point along the curved channel onto a linear space. We measure the distance between these points
to determine the length of each and every bubble, from which we determine the gas/liquid ratio.
</p>

<p>
To deal with droplets or dust fibers in the optics, we employ a blemish detection algorithm which identifies stationary objects and marks them as holes in the image data. These holes are then filled with data points interpolated from neighboring known measurements.

IT Support and Software Development</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
   <img alt="Conveyor" src="Images/conveyor.jpg" align="left" />From 2005 to 2008, I held the role of programmer and IT technician at Thomson’s consumer electronics warehouse in Indianapolis, 
   including maintanence and further development of a previous project, &quot;WMS 
   Batch&quot;, detailed below. I formulated queries and developed reports for 
   billing, inventory, and productivity. Additionally, my responsibilities included tracking, prioritizing, troubleshooting and resolving problems  
   so as to improve and maintain efficiency. I maintained backups and deployed system updates. I established and implemented policies to minimize risks to data and uptime. In addition to hands-on application of computing skills, I accomplished these goals through interaction with managers, warehouse staff, vendors, and customer staff.
</p>
<p>
At 900,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of floor space, the warehouse was Thomson’s largest 
   facility in the Americas. I supported users of 100 PC workstations throughout the 
   site, including hardware, OS, and standard office/reporting applications, plus 
   network printers. Using Wavelink products, I configured and managed 450 wireless 
   portable computers located in Indianapolis, Toronto, California, and Mexico, 
   sometimes applying my comprehension of written and spoken Spanish. I prepared custom labels in Zebra ZPL, 
   for bulk printing. My responsibilities extended into networking and telephony. Finally, I provided server and control system support for 1.3 miles of automated pick-and-pass conveyor until April 2007, when Thomson sold the associated business.&nbsp;

<h2>Thomson </h2>
   <h2>"WMS Batch" Shipping Software</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
<!-- img alt="Conveyor" src="Images/conveyor.jpg"  -->
In 2002, I developed the WMS Batch application for Thomson Consumer Electronics, Inc. This program processed outgoing truckload shipments and was used by warehouse personnel at several sites. The program’s two basic functions can be 
   summarized as shipment verification and data collection. The program 
   resided on handheld computers and, to promote speed and accuracy, most input was via the device’s integrated bar code reader.

<h4>Shipment Accuracy Verification</h4>

<p>Users used WMS Batch to verify the accuracy of shipments as each was staged on the warehouse floor prior to 
   loading on the trailer. The details of a shipment were retrieved wirelessly from 
   Thomson&#39;s warehouse management system (Yantra WMS). WMS Batch then prompted the user to collect appropriate shipment data from product labeling, and it verified that this matched the intended contents of the load. Verification consisted, in part, of these items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Serial numbers were verified to be unique and non-duplicated, reducing user error</li>
<li>An automatic product recall search was performed in a remote Oracle database</li>
<li>To help ensure order accuracy, PO numbers and product model numbers were verified to be correct for the order</li>
<li>Product quantities were verified in order to avoid the cost associated with over or under-shipment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p>In addition to shipment verification, the application simultaneously served as a data collection tool. This data was uploaded to corporate servers for archival; for customer support and order-tracking services.</p>

<ul>
<li>Serial numbers were collected from products such as satellite receivers. This allowed Thomson to keep track of the destination of each individual unit, essential to warranty fulfillment and prevention of fraud and theft</li>
<li>Product counts were uploaded to the existing Yantra WMS application. This served as documentation of shipment contents and enabled 
   subsequent inventory, manifesting, and billing transactions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p><img alt="Portable Terminal" src="Images/term.gif" align="left" height="90" 
      width="60"/>I wrote WMS Batch in Visual C++ 1.52, and it ran on the DOS-based model PDT-7542 wireless handheld computer by Symbol Technologies 
   (now Motorola). 802.11 wireless Ethernet allowed raw TCP/IP communication with the “dumpstation”, a custom service 
   which I programmed, running on a Windows NT PC. The dumpstation provided the interface between WMS Batch and Yantra WMS, an Oracle-based application running on an AIX server. As part of a subsequent project, I wrote the server-side Pro*C process which permits the DOS device to query the Oracle database for product recalls.</p>

<h2>Aearo </h2>
   <h2>Print Controller</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Aearo Print Controller queues and monitors the printing of large batches of shipping labels concurrently to multiple high-speed thermal printers. It serves as a label-printing utility for an existing picking/shipping application.</p>

<img alt="Screenshot" src="Images/aearo.jpg" height="200" width = "400"/>

<p>Project benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended application lifetime. The original picking/shipping application relied on discontinued printers for which parts and service 
   were dwindling. I ported all existing label code to produce output suitable for current equipment</li>
<li>Time savings. The main picking/shipping application is freed for picking and shipping tasks even while batches of thousands of labels are running on multiple printers. Prior to this project, the entire application could become tied up for hours while printing to a single printer</li>
<li>Reprint capability. The Print Controller stores all label data for a configurable number of days, after which it is purged. Batches can be reprinted without interfering with the picking/shipping application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>I wrote the Aearo Print Controller primarily in Visual Basic, as per customer 
   specification. A DLL written in C provides some interfaces to the Windows printing APIs. I modified the existing picking/shipping application, developed in-house by Aearo in FoxPro, to incorporate support for the Print Controller. In addition, I ported all label layout code from the discontinued Sato line of printers to Zebra’s ZPL.</p>

   <h2>&nbsp;Fuel System Tester
I/O Update</h2>

<img alt="Tester" src="Images/tester.gif" align="left"/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Fuel System Tester is a custom-built quality-assurance device used by Modine Manufacturing Co. to verify the proper function of their automotive fuel system components. The machine consists primarily of a specialized test fixture, a PC running custom software, and an automatic multimeter, all integrated into one system. Two generations of this system were built. My contribution consisted of the software changes necessary for the PC program to communicate with a newer multimeter component, which replaced the previous.</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Details</h3>
<p>
Users operate the tester by first locking the product into the test fixture. 
   They initiate the test by placing a finger from each hand in a proximity sensor, 
   confirming that the hands are clear of high voltage. The software responds to 
   the proximity sensors by commencing the test process. The multimeter probes are 
   routed to the appropriate terminals via a network of relays. Commands are sent 
   via RS-232 to the automatic multimeter which returns a reading. In this fashion, 
   various types of readings are performed across corresponding terminal pairs in 
   rapid succession. Electrical properties tested include resistance, capacitance, 
   and inductance. These are displayed to the operator at the end of testing, all 
   of which takes roughly four seconds per unit. Each reading is compared to a 
   configurable threshold, and a simple pass/fail result is displayed.</p>
